# HS-Kleinanzeigen
This Project was done during the Lecture Java Enterprise Datenbankanwendungsentwicklung.
# Project idea
The aim of the project is to develop an online platform for classified ads. The service enables
the free creation and search of bids and requests of commodities or
rooms in shared flats.
The platform serves only to mediate between sellers and interested parties. A possible
Purchase transaction is not supported.
# Description
